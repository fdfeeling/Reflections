When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You may want to use a remote repository if multiple people are collaborating or if you are working from multiple computers
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    
    You may want to debug all changes before you upload the file to Github
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

	fork occurs when you copy another's repository on Github to your Github account
	clone is when you copy a repository onto your local computer
	branch occurs when you want to write new code but not update the master
